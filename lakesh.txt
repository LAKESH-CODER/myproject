If you only want to group by technology but still retrieve all columns, you can use window functions or DISTINCT ON (PostgreSQL-specific) depending on your use case.

In SQL, you can group data without applying any aggregation by simply using the GROUP BY clause. However, itâ€™s important to note that all non-aggregated columns in the SELECT clause must be included in the GROUP BY clause.
